mysql hash encryption (for password)

the authentication should be based on a hashed key stored in your MySQL databsase. Look at various PHP 
encryption functions for possible routines to use in this regard. The actual encryption chosen will not 
play a role in the assessment. The site will use cookies or session variables to store and use such 
things as the date and time of site access or the last item viewed or searched for so that on subsequent
visits the site can use these to welcome the user etc. To ensure that it is not possible for someone to 
directly enter a back end URL to administer the site thus bypassing the authentication, all of the back 
end pages should check and use one or more session variables that are set after the initial 
authentication before allowing the script to continue. The session data should be removed after logout 
or a short timeout has occurred.
